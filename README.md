just a dude from Poland. Always studying new things; mainly an artist and hobbyist archivist,
but coding is really fun! I'm really bad at this stuff so you'll most likely see a lot of mistakes 
in whatever I manage to scrounge up from the depths of my brain.

I used to know mostly Ruby and C#, but Python, C++, and Rust make a little more sense to me now.
Still, please teach me if you're willing to do so, cause I honestly have no idea what I'm doing.
This is just a cool hobby for me! But I sure do love to learn, hence my request. 

Currently a webadmin, illustrator and zinemaker, and resident "walking art knowledge library".
